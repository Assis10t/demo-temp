\begin{itemize}
    \item B.O.B structure such that he can move.
    \item B.O.B will be able to move by following a line.
    \item Server: Able to view orders, queue items needed to be collected and build a route and a set of commands for the robot to deliver each item to the bagging area. --- Mongo DB server connects to node express ... Connects to back-end. Basic functionality  - robot app connected to server. Zero conflict when connecting to server, IP changes accordingly. Server can make robot move with reqUEST FROM APP OR WEBSITE.
    \item App: Able to read and display the available items in the warehouse; allow the clients to create individual accounts, select items and place orders.  Working prototype with the ability to place an order. --- Finds and Connects to server. Displays list of items, can place orders, robot moves, order placed.
    \item Website: Able to add and update items in the warehouse. --- On and Off
